# `.gitignore` Organization Summary

This document outlines the key files and folders being ignored in your repository to maintain cleanliness, security, and build consistency.

---

## 🚫 Key Files/Folders Being Ignored

### 🔧 Critical Build Artifacts
- `src-tauri/target/` – Rust compilation artifacts (can exceed 100MB)
- `src-tauri/gen/` – Tauri auto-generated schema files
- `node_modules/` – Node.js dependencies (can be regenerated)

### 🖥️ System Files Found in Project
- `.DS_Store` files (8 instances found)
- macOS system files (e.g., Spotlight, Trashes, etc.)

### 💻 Development Environment
- IDE configurations (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Log files and temporary working files
- Environment variable files (`.env*`)

### 🔐 Security & Sensitive Data
- API keys, certificates, secrets
- Private keys and certificates

### 🔮 Future-Proofing
- Mobile development artifacts (for future iOS/Android support)
- Alternative package manager files (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- Testing outputs and coverage reports

## ✅ Important Files **KEPT** in Git

- `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` – Ensures consistent Rust dependencies
- `package-lock.json` – Ensures consistent Node.js dependencies
- `src-tauri/icons/icon.png` – Application icon  
  _(Note: `.bak` backup versions are ignored)_

---

## 🛠️ Project-Specific Additions

- `src-tauri/icons/*.bak` – Ignores icon backup files created during setup
- Tauri 2.x specific generated directories
- Paths related to mobile development for future expansion

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Recommendation

To fully align with your `.gitignore`, consider removing any already committed `.DS_Store` files from version control using:

```bash
git rm --cached $(find . -name .DS_Store)
